## 🔧 Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Bootstrap 5 (Grid, Utility classes, Progress bar, Card)
- CSS
- responsive layout
- Google Fonts 

## 💡 Features

- Responsive layout using Bootstrap grid
- Custom gradient progress bar
- Tooltip-style display for remaining storage
- WCAG-friendly text sizes and contrast

## 🔍 Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was creating the tooltip-like element that shows "185GB Left." I had to use custom CSS positioning and a pseudo-element to create the triangle below it. Another issue was customizing the Bootstrap progress bar to apply the gradient background and rounded corners.

## 🪞 Reflection

This project helped reinforce my knowledge of Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes. It was a good challenge to limit the use of custom CSS while still achieving a pixel-accurate layout. I learned how to overlay elements using absolute positioning and how to customize Bootstrap components to match a Figma design. If I had more time, I would improve the tooltip by adding a hover effect and test more screen sizes. This project also improved my Git commit workflow, as I practiced writing clear commit messages.
